## Purpose

Solana is a new blockchain protocol that has garrnered interest in the technology space due to its unique proof of history consensus algorithm that results in lightning fast transaction times. However, it has been plagued by numerous outages and scandals, most notably the bankruptcy of FTX, which invested heavily into the Solana ecosystem. Due to this, it would be helpful to keep track of the development and community sentiment around this growing ecosystem. Solana could be useful as a case study to be able to understand what makes a blockchain protocol successful and able to maintain community and developer support. The aim of this project is to build an automated pipeline to gather and synthesize data from community discussion around Solana. Using the [PRAW API](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) we will extract posts and comments from the [Solana subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/). This data will be transformed and then summarized into a dashboard to extract insight from the discussions of the burgeoning Solana community.


## Questions This Project Seeks to Answer

* Who are the top posters on the subreddit?
* What posts have the most engagement? (Most comments, upvotes, etc.)
* What is the average sentiment over time?
* Do the posts who have the most upvotes always have the most comments?
